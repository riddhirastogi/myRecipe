Making Paneer Makhani
Melt butter in a pan. First add the tejpatta/bay leaf and saute for a few seconds till aromatic.
Then add the crushed ginger-garlic paste and saute till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away.
Add the tomato puree and stir well.
Now add the red chili powder and saute this mixture till the fat begins to leave the side of the tomato paste. Takes about 14 to 15 on a low flame. Keep on stirring often.
When you see the tomato mixture clumping together and the fat leaving the sides, then add water.
Stir and simmer till the gravy or sauce thickens a bit. Takes about 7 to 8 mins on a low flame.
Then add the slit green chilies and ginger julienne. Stir and simmer for a minute.
Add sugar, salt and crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves).
Stir and then add the paneer cubes. 
Simmer the gravy for 2 to 3 minutes till the paneer cubes are cooked.
Lastly add cream and gently stir. Switch off the flame and then sprinkle with garam masala. Give a gentle stir again.
Serve the paneer makhani with rotis, naan or jeera rice.
